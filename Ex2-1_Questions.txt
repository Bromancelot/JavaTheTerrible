Exercise 2-1

6.) Restart the application, enter a valid subtotal, and enter 20 when the
program asks you whether you want to continue. What happens and why?

The application finished it's process and ended. Since I did not say yes(y) the
application assumed I wanted to exit. Then exited. Since the choice is defined
as a string, it will accept "20" as an answer.
The only answer that is defined to do anything else is "Y".


7.) Restart the application and enter two values separated by whitespace (like
1000 20) before pressing the Enter key. What happened and why?

Nothing. I haven't pressed the enter key.
